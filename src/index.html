        <h1>Last companies I worked with:</h1>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/">Objectivity</a> - Software House, with multiple projects I took part of. Some of them required me to set up testing process, as well as lead the newly built QA team for some time, and then move to another project.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.smartpatient.eu/">Smartpatient</a> - Company with their own product - mobile application <a href="https://www.mytherapyapp.com/">MyTherapy</a>, released on both iOS and Android. As of 2023, it's rating on Google Play is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.smartpatient.mytherapy&hl=en&gl=US">4.7/5 out of 156 000 reviews</a> which makes me proud of its quality. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.bik.pl/">Biuro Informacji Kredytowej (BIK)</a> - Polish government-connected company. Their QA challenges were quite unique (and therefore experienced I gained by working there) because of multiple integrations with data-heavy financial systems. My work there was mainly integration tests using Postman (REST API) and Oracle SQL to ensure their databases are saving proper data.
